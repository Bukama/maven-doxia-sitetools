Doxia Sitetool Decoration Model

 This is strictly the model for Doxia Sitetool Decoration Model, used in maven-site-plugin as <<<site.xml>>>.

 The following are generated from this model:

   * {{{./apidocs/index.html}Java sources}} with Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser

   * A {{{./decoration.html}Descriptor Reference}}

   * An XSD referenced in the {{{./decoration.html}Descriptor Reference}}.

 Inheritance algorithm is added to merge the decoration between a parent and a child.
